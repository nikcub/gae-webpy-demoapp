This application is a demo of Google App Engine and using the web.py framework on that platform. If you are interested in using web.py on GAE, this would be an ideal starting point.

I have included:

 * Demo templates (a base template and examples)
 * jQuery
 * CSS template 
 * demo js
 * demonstration models 
 * demo of including other libraries in /vendors

Install

Grab the App Engine SDK:

  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Then run the demo via:

  $ cd gae-webpy-demoapp
  $ dev_appserver.py .
